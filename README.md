## Task 03: Build a decision tree classifier

**📄 Description**

  For my third task, Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. I selected the **Bank Marketing** dataset from Kaggle.
  This is the classic marketing bank dataset uploaded originally in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset gives you information about a marketing campaign of a financial institution in which you will have to 
  analyze in order to find ways to look for future strategies in order to improve future marketing campaigns for the bank.
